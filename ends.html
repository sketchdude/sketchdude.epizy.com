      <h1>Questions and Answers</h1>
      <p>I get all kinds of questions and here are some I've had several times before.</p>
      <h3>What is your work about?</h3>
      <p>For me, it's about describing certain aspects of shadows and sharing my fascination with anyone who wants to enjoy it. It's also about tradition. I'm probably the most staunch traditionalist you ever met.</p>
      <h3>What does traditional realism mean to you?</h3>
      <p>Well, I am a 55 year old single man, who never chose a wife or had any children. As I see it, this convention of describing shadows with various media has been the single thing in my life that has bought me a degree of personal happiness. It's personal. Traditional realism created a bond between me and my mother. Without that bond my relationship with mom would have been just as disfunctional as most of my other family relationships.</p>
      <p>I am aware of the general academic opinion of the educated western world concerning realism. I can see why educated people feel the way they do, but for me, my first obligation is to try to preserve this tradition for the future. That more than anything has guided my choice of subject matter, pretty much from day one.</p>
      <h3>What is your asthetic?</h3>
      <p>I stole my asthetic from something Bob Dylan said way back in the sixties: He said, <em>I'll let you be in my dream if I can be is yours</em>. That defines what I call beautiful or meaningful in just about any of the creative arts. I believe that's how aesthetics have always been defined in the real world, so why not just say it and get on with it. I like what I like and so do you!</p>
      <p>I never bought in to the creative ideal. I don't hold the opinion that the more creative an artist is, the better they are. I also never bought into the idea that realism is superior. I have my taste- which means that most art and literature is crap. Most realism is crap. There are only a few cases where artists seem to get it right.</p>
      <h3>Do you think there needs to be standards in art?</h3>
      <p>No. What we need more of in the arts is <em>appreciation</em>, not standards to say who can or can't be an artist. To appreciate art, you don't have to like it- but you damn well have to acknowledge that some of your fellow human beings like it. For cripes sake, extend some dignity. After modernism, realism pretty much got defined as a form as bigotry. Realists don't help their own case when they ignore the talent of abstract expressionists, or conceptual artists.</p>
      <p>I like the yin and yang- consider yin and yang in terms of expressive modes. Check out I-Ching and the symbols for the creative and the receptive. What I like about these symbols is that niether one of them is considered to superior to the other. I've always been a believer that you can have realism without the superiority. You can have aesthetics without the bigotry of self superiority.</p>
      <h3>How did you learn to paint so skillfully?</h3>
      <p>I'm really not as skillful as people make me out to be. I don't think I even heard of the term "technical skill" before I went to art school. In the first place, at school they didn't even get the skill right- they were describing so-called technical skill as this precise mathematical sort of hand eye coordination- but that isn't the skill I was using to draw confidently. My skill is simply visualization. I've never been intimidated by a blank canvas because I can see the whole thing already finished before I even reach for a brush.</p>
      <h3>What religeon/philosophy are you?</h3>
      <p>I consider myself a pretty devout agnostic. I never liked atheism because It seems to me nobody really knows whether or not there is such a thing as God. I certainly don't know what the ultimate truth is, so it seems idiotic to go around saying there is or isn't. If I had to choose a religeon, I'd probably become a buddhist (therevada) and go be a monk. I don't do that because I love painting and music too much.</p>
      <h3>Don't you think realism has been done already?</h3>
      <p>To who's satisfaction, Yours? Not mine- It won't be done to my satisfaction until I've had my say. Realism always changes for the simple reason that times always change.</p>
      <p>Honestly, I don't consider that a valid critisism, because you can say the same thing about any established genre and be just as correct. It's all been done before. To you, that may seem like an obvious fact. To me, it's just a reflection your own attitude. In my opinion, nothing has been done before.</p>
      <h3>Why don't you paint nice things in your still lifes?</h3>
      <p>I do paint nice things! Shadows and lights are very nice things. They represent life- as it is. not as it's supposed to be or ought to be. Photos are nice things. I'm as proud of my photography skills as I am of my painting skills. It's true I use crappy camera equipment, but I do great things with photoshop. Some of my favorite contemporary music is made with cheap guitars.</p>
      <h3>What makes great art?</h3>
      <p>Great people make great art. Great hardships make great people. If you find yourself living in a time when there aren't any great people, <em>count your lucky stars!</em></p>
