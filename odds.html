      <h1>Odd Happenings Lately</h1>
      <p>About this site- I designed it myself back in 2014. I'm proud of this design because it was the first site I ever did that uses <a target ="blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">CSS</a>. I have just recently gotten online again thanks to my roomate, who is loaning me her laptop in exchange for me loaning her my smartphone.</p>
      <p>This laptop, an HP 15 has been lying around for a couple years. It got left behind by one of our previous roomates, who unfortunatly passed away not long after moving out. We never even knew if the thing worked or not, since the battery was dead and there was no power cord.</p>
      <p>Well we finally found a cord and plugged it in, only to find it wouldn't boot up. The hard drive was bad. I got out all my old cd roms and found a couple of <a target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD">Linux Live CDs</a>, and sure enough it booted right up and ran like a champ. From there we were able to find a good used hard drive for $35.00 and now we have a good little computer.</p>
      <p>I installed <a target="blank" href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and now I have all these software tools that would have cost several thousand dollars to run on windows. So hopefully I can get a new site going and get back to my creative projects full time again.</p>
      <P>To meet my goals, I need help. I need equipment- my own PC, scanner and a decent camera at the very minimum.</P>
      <h1>What's next?</h1>
      <p>This past year I've been moving past the still life paintings so I can concentrate more on portrait/figurative works. Most recently I've been doing fan art- portrait drawings of famous people I admire: Freud & Jung, Picasso, the beatles, Steven Hawking, etc. Of course whenever I push one extreme, my mind always jumps to the opposite. I had these people who represented the best of humanity, so then I started a series of the worst- serial killers, crooks, terrorists. Anyway my roomate got so upset at one of the terrorists, she damn near asked me to move out.</p>
      <p>What I was working towards was an idea I had for a big major history painting. I've wanted to do this for a long time- the execution of Mary Queen of Scots. What always stumped me on the idea was the actual drawings made at the time of the execution. I just couldn't see a way to illustrate that scene in a visually interesting way,</p>
